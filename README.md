ReactiveLocation library for Android
====================================

A trimmed back fork of the [Android Reactive Locations](https://github.com/mcharmas/Android-ReactiveLocation)
library. The library size has been reduced by trimming the library down to just the location API -
the original library also includes Geofencing and Places API.

Small library that wraps Google Play Services API in brilliant [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
```Observables``` reducing boilerplate to minimum.

Current stable version - 1.1
---------------

**This version works with Google Play Services 10.2.1 and RxJava 1.2.9+**

What can you do with that?
--------------------------

* easily connect to Play Services API
* obtain last known location
* subscribe for location updates
* use location settings API

How does the API look like?
----------------------------

Simple. All you need is to create ```ReactiveLocationProvider``` using your context.
All observables are already there. Examples are worth more than 1000 words:


### Getting last known location

```java
ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
locationProvider.getLastKnownLocation()
    .subscribe(new Action1<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Location location) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
        }
    });
```


### Subscribing for location updates

```java
LocationRequest request = LocationRequest.create() //standard GMS LocationRequest
                                  .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                                  .setNumUpdates(5)
                                  .setInterval(100);

ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
Subscription subscription = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(request)
    .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
    .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
    .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
    ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
    .subscribe(new Action1<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Location location) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
        }
    });
```

When you are done (for example in ```onStop()```) remember to unsubscribe.

```java
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

### Subscribing for Activity Recognition

Getting activity recognition is just as simple

```java

ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
Subscription subscription = locationProvider.getDetectedActivity(0) // detectionIntervalMillis
    .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
    .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
    .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
    ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
    .subscribe(new Action1<ActivityRecognitionResult>() {
        @Override
        public void call(ActivityRecognitionResult detectedActivity) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedActivity(detectedActivity);
        }
    });
```

### Creating observable from PendingResult

If you are manually using Google Play Services and you are dealing with
```PendingResult``` you can easily transform them to observables with
```ReactiveLocationProvider.fromPendingResult()``` method.

### Cooler examples

Do you need location with certain accuracy but don't want to wait for it more than 4 sec? No problem.

```java
LocationRequest req = LocationRequest.create()
                         .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                         .setExpirationDuration(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS))
                         .setInterval(LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL);

Observable<Location> goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(req)
            .filter(new Func1<Location, Boolean>() {
                @Override
                public Boolean call(Location location) {
                    return location.getAccuracy() < SUFFICIENT_ACCURACY;
                }
            })
            .timeout(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Observable.just((Location) null), AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .first()
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());

goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable.subscribe(...);
```


How to use it?
--------------

Library is available in maven central.

### Gradle

Just use it as dependency in your *build.gradle* file
along with Google Play Services and RxJava.

```groovy

allprojects {
	repositories {
		// ...
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}

dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.github.ktchernov:Android-ReactiveLocation:v1.0'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:8.4.0' //you can use newer GMS version if you need
    compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:1.2.9' //you can override RxJava version with a newer 1.x version if you wish
}
```

Sample
------

Sample usage is available in *sample* directory.

Places API requires API Key. Before running samples you need to create project on API console
and obtain API Key using this [guide](https://developers.google.com/places/android/signup).
Obtained key should be exported as gradle property named: ```REACTIVE_LOCATION_GMS_API_KEY``` for
example in ```~/.gradle/gradle.properties```.
